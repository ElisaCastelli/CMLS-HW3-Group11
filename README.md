# CMLS - HW3 - Voice Harmonizer

The aim of the third homework assigned to our group is to develop a vocal harmonizer. This application, whose features reconcile different disciplinary areas (such as object-oriented programming, sound and music), converts the voice into a musically richer version of itself. In fact, the input audio captured by the microphone is returned in polyphonic form with respect to some reference chords, resulting in multiple overlapping versions of the same voice, harmonically coherent with each other. We also decided to implement two sound effects which can be applied to the output voice (delay and reverb). As specifed in the guidelines, this tool was developed using SuperCollider, a free and open source software for sound synthesis and real-time control, along with its communication protocol OSC. Concerning the implementation of the graphical user interface, we decided to use Processing 3 for managing the parameters of the harmonization and the sound effects.
